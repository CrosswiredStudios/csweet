# Phase 7 - Business Onboarding

## Goal

Create the first business onboarding flow that captures enough company context for C-Sweet to create default roles, a strategic objective, an initial task backlog, and a default local worker.

## Why this phase matters

After system setup, users need to create the business context that agents will operate inside. This is the start of the actual C-Sweet experience.

## Deliverables

- `/business-onboarding` route.
- Organization creation form implemented in the shared `CSweet.UI` Razor library.
- Initial context capture.
- Default role creation.
- First strategic objective creation.
- Initial task backlog generation.
- Default local strategy worker registration.
- Redirect to organization command center.
- Shared API client and UI state that can be used by both the Blazor WASM host and the future MAUI Blazor Hybrid host.

## Business onboarding fields

Minimum fields:

```text
Business name
Industry
Stage
Primary goal
Current constraints
Preferred operating style
```

Optional later fields:

```text
Target customer
Revenue model
Team size
Budget
Existing website
Existing tools
Risk tolerance
Brand voice
```

## Stages

Start with a simple list:

```text
Idea
Pre-revenue
Early revenue
Growing
Established
```

## Preferred operating style

This helps shape future agent behavior.

Options:

```text
Conservative and careful
Balanced and practical
Aggressive growth
Experimental
```

## Default roles

When onboarding completes, create these roles:

### CEO

Responsibilities:

- Define company direction.
- Prioritize objectives.
- Approve major decisions.
- Coordinate roles.

Authority level:

```text
ExecutionWithApproval
```

### Operations

Responsibilities:

- Identify operational bottlenecks.
- Create processes.
- Track execution.

### Finance

Responsibilities:

- Estimate costs.
- Evaluate revenue assumptions.
- Identify financial risks.

### Marketing

Responsibilities:

- Define target customer.
- Suggest channels.
- Draft messaging.

### Product

Responsibilities:

- Clarify offering.
- Prioritize features or services.
- Convert goals into deliverables.

## Initial strategic objective

Create one objective from the primary goal.

Example:

```text
Title: Establish a 30-day launch plan
Description: Create a practical operating plan that turns the business goal into immediate actions, risks, owners, and deliverables.
Status: Active
```

## Initial task backlog

Create these tasks:

```text
Define target customer
Draft basic operating plan
Identify first revenue channel
List operational risks
Create 30-day execution plan
```

The first task that should be executable by an agent is:

```text
Create 30-day execution plan
```

## Default local worker

Register a worker:

```text
Name: Local Strategy Agent
WorkerType: LocalAgent
ExecutionMode: InProcess or LocalWorkerHost
Capabilities:
  - business-planning
  - operating-plan
  - task-breakdown
  - risk-identification
RequiresHumanApproval: true
```

This worker uses the default chat provider configured during setup.

## API endpoint

```http
POST /api/business-onboarding/complete
```

Request:

```json
{
  "businessName": "Example Co",
  "industry": "Software",
  "stage": "Idea",
  "primaryGoal": "Launch a paid MVP in 30 days",
  "constraints": ["solo founder", "limited budget"],
  "preferredOperatingStyle": "Balanced and practical"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "organizationId": "...",
  "createdRoleCount": 5,
  "createdTaskCount": 5,
  "defaultWorkerId": "...",
  "nextRoute": "/organizations/{id}/command-center"
}
```

## Command center destination

After onboarding, redirect to:

```text
/organizations/{organizationId}/command-center
```

Initial command center sections:

```text
Company summary
Primary goal
Roles
Open tasks
Workers
Recent artifacts
Pending approvals
Recommended next action
```

## Web and mobile parity requirements

The business onboarding and command center UI must be host-neutral. Product pages, layouts, form models, validation behavior, and API client calls belong in `CSweet.UI`; `CSweet.App` should only host the shared route for the browser.

Do not place onboarding workflow logic directly in the Blazor WASM host. The future `CSweet.Mobile` project must be able to reference the same `CSweet.UI` route and render an identical experience inside MAUI Blazor Hybrid.

Host-specific behavior should be abstracted behind interfaces when needed:

```text
Local storage / secure storage
Clipboard
File picker
Deep links
Notifications
Device/browser detection
```

The onboarding layout must be responsive enough for:

```text
Desktop browser
Tablet viewport
Phone viewport inside MAUI BlazorWebView
```

## Testing requirements

### Unit tests

- Business onboarding creates organization.
- Default roles are created.
- Initial objective is created.
- Initial task backlog is created.
- Local strategy worker is registered.

### Integration tests

- Complete onboarding endpoint returns organization ID.
- Created organization can be loaded.
- Role count is 5.
- Task count is 5.
- Default worker exists.

### UI/manual tests

- User can submit onboarding form.
- Validation messages appear for missing business name and primary goal.
- User lands on command center.
- Onboarding and command center render correctly at phone, tablet, and desktop widths.
- Once `CSweet.Mobile` exists, the same `CSweet.UI` onboarding route renders inside the MAUI Blazor Hybrid host without duplicating page code.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Business onboarding is blocked until first-run setup is complete.
- [ ] User can create first business.
- [ ] Default roles are created.
- [ ] Initial objective is created.
- [ ] Initial tasks are created.
- [ ] Default local strategy worker is available.
- [ ] User lands on command center.
- [ ] Business onboarding and command center product UI live in `CSweet.UI`, not directly in `CSweet.App`.
- [ ] The implementation has no WebAssembly-only dependency in shared onboarding UI code.
