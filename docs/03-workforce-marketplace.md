# Unified Workforce Marketplace

## Purpose

The marketplace is a unified catalog of labor and capability. It should support local AI workers, remote commercial workers, human professionals, agencies, and hybrid services.

The marketplace is optional for self-hosted installations. The open-source core must support included workers and direct provider connections without requiring the official marketplace.

## Marketplace offering types

### Local open-source worker

- Downloadable and inspectable definition
- Runs through the user’s selected local or hosted model
- May declare required MCP servers or tools
- Can operate offline when dependencies are local
- Usually free
- Can be distributed through GitHub, a registry, or the official marketplace

### Remote commercial worker

- Executes on the publisher’s infrastructure
- May use proprietary models, prompts, data, code, and MCP services
- Requires network access to the publisher
- Publisher enforces licensing and billing
- Local installation contains a read-only descriptor and connection configuration
- May be offered by a large software vendor or a small specialist provider

### Human professional

- Real person with a profile, skills, availability, credentials, rates, and reviews
- Must accept an engagement before becoming active company staff
- Can work hourly, fixed price, by milestone, on retainer, or through packaged services
- May delegate preparation work to authorized agents

### Hybrid service

- Provider-managed combination of software, AI agents, and human work
- May expose multiple roles under one provider workspace
- Must disclose execution composition and human-review behavior
- May charge for software usage, professional review, or both

## Workforce provider

A provider may publish several related offerings and share authentication, billing, data connections, and service policies.

Example:

```text
Intuit Workforce Provider
├── Bookkeeper
├── Accountant
├── Tax Professional
├── Payroll Specialist
└── Expense Auditor
```

A future provider such as Intuit could expose accounting and tax workers backed by proprietary models, rules engines, connected financial data, MCP servers, and optional human professionals.

## Important distinctions

```text
Offering       Product or service advertised by a publisher
Version        Immutable machine-executed implementation version
Listing        Public presentation and sales page
Entitlement    Company’s right to use a commercial offering
Connection     Authenticated link to a provider workspace
Engagement     Accepted agreement with a human or managed service
Staff Member   Company-specific worker instance
```

## Marketplace installation sources

Self-hosted users should be able to add workers through:

1. Official marketplace
2. Direct manifest URL
3. Manually uploaded descriptor
4. Private enterprise registry
5. Included source-controlled role pack

The official marketplace should not be a runtime dependency for locally installed workers.

## Search and recommendations

Marketplace search should filter and rank by:

- Capability
- Resource type
- Price and pricing model
- Availability
- Location and time zone
- Credentials and jurisdiction
- Local versus remote execution
- Data-processing policy
- Model and tool requirements
- Reviews and verified performance
- Provider reliability
- Compatibility with company policies

The Personal Assistant should be able to search the marketplace and present staffing options. Financial commitments require configured authority or approval.

## Pricing models

Potential models include:

- Free
- One-time license
- Monthly or annual subscription
- Per company
- Per active worker
- Per task
- Per token
- Per transaction or functionality unit
- Hourly
- Fixed price
- Milestone
- Retainer
- Paid consultation
- Custom enterprise contract

The marketplace should store pricing disclosures.

Remote providers remain authoritative for their own usage billing. Human engagements use platform contracts and payment records.

## Service meters

Remote providers may define billable units such as:

- Model tokens
- Transactions categorized
- Accounts reconciled
- Reports generated
- Human reviews
- Payroll runs
- Forms prepared
- Images generated
- Build minutes
- Premium data queries

The core budgeting system should treat meters as named quantities with optional monetary estimates and limits.

## Reviews and reputation

Reputation should include structured dimensions:

- Work quality
- Communication
- Timeliness
- Reliability
- Instruction adherence
- Cost accuracy
- Rework frequency
- Completion rate
- Rehire or renewal rate
- Dispute rate
- Credential status
- Provider availability

Reviews should be tied to verified use. Public performance metrics must have clear definitions and context.

## Credentials

The system must distinguish:

- Self-declared
- Provider-asserted
- Marketplace-verified
- Government or credential-provider verified

Professional offerings should identify:

- Jurisdiction
- Expiration
- Permitted service scope
- Verification source

A role title alone must never imply a verified license.

## Trust and execution disclosures

Every listing should clearly show:

- Execution type
- Where data is processed
- Whether data leaves the self-hosted environment
- Retention and training policy
- Required permissions
- Required tools and provider connections
- Whether humans may access the data
- Typical response time
- Service availability expectations
- Pricing basis

## Versioning and updates

Machine-executed versions are immutable.

An update that requests new permissions requires company approval.

Companies should choose among:

- Pinned version
- Manual updates
- Automatic patch updates
- Automatic minor updates
- Preview channel

The marketplace may delist or disable compromised versions while preserving customer history and artifacts.

## Marketplace moderation

Submission pipeline:

1. Draft
2. Identity or publisher verification
3. Descriptor and package validation
4. Permission and data-policy review
5. Compatibility testing
6. Behavioral evaluation where applicable
7. Human marketplace review
8. Publication

Potential automated checks include:

- Embedded secrets
- Undeclared network access
- Schema compliance
- Permission escalation
- Runaway execution
- Deceptive claims
- Compatibility
- Billing-meter consistency
- Credential validity

## Hosted and open-source boundaries

Open-source core responsibilities:

- Workforce abstractions
- Provider and professional contracts
- Direct installation
- Company staffing
- Task orchestration
- Budget enforcement
- Local audit history

Likely hosted marketplace responsibilities:

- Discovery and search
- Publisher accounts
- Identity verification
- Paid transactions
- Payouts
- Reviews
- Disputes
- Moderation
- Service-health aggregation
- Credential verification

## Marketplace principle

The marketplace should answer:

> What combination of local agents, commercial services, and real professionals can complete this work within the company’s budget, permissions, schedule, quality, and risk requirements?
